"""E2E collaboration tests — multi-agent delegation with signed governance.

Mirrors CrewAI's "Collaboration in Action" example:
  https://docs.crewai.com/en/concepts/collaboration#collaboration-in-action

Three DID-signed agents with ``allow_delegation=True`` collaborate on a
single task. The Content Writer owns the task and delegates research to
the Research Specialist and editorial review to the Content Editor.
Every agent's ``execute_task`` call — including delegations routed
through CrewAI's built-in delegation tool — is intercepted by OpenBox
governance and signed with that agent's DID.

The captured_calls fixture records every outgoing governance evaluation
so the tests can assert that signing happened for each participating
agent. When delegation provenance ships, the same fixture lets a one-line
addition assert ``payload.metadata["delegating_agent_role"]`` on
delegated sub-task evaluations.

Prerequisites:
  - Three OpenBox agents registered with DID identities provisioned
  - The rego in ``collaboration_policy.rego`` attached to each
  - API keys + DIDs + private keys set in ``.env`` (see ``.env.example``)

Usage:
    python3 -m tests.e2e.collaboration.test_collaboration
