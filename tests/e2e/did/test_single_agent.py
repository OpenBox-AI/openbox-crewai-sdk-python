"""E2E test — single OpenBoxAgent with a configured DID + private key.

Runs a minimal governed crew (1 agent, 1 task) with Agent Identity Protocol
signing enabled. Every governance call Core receives will carry the 5 AIP
headers and Core will verify the Ed25519 signature against the alias
alias/openbox-agent/<didUuid>.

Prerequisites (in this folder's .env):
    OPENBOX_URL                             Core base URL
    OPENAI_API_KEY / OPENAI_MODEL_NAME      LLM for CrewAI
    OPENBOX_DID_TESTER_API_KEY              API for a provisioned agent
    OPENBOX_DID_TESTER_DID                  did:aip:<uuid> matching that agent
    OPENBOX_DID_TESTER_PRIVATE_KEY          base64 32-byte Ed25519 seed

The agent referenced by the API key must already have its KMS alias
provisioned with the matching public key.

Usage:
    uv run python3 -m pytest tests/e2e/did/ -v
